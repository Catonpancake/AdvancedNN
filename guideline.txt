Here's a fun dataset to play around with.
The attached file contains a zip-file called 'retina1_trainvalid.zip'
If you unzip it, you will find a folder with fundus images, called 'trainvalid' and a text-file 'labels_trainvalid.txt' containing 0 and 1. Take a look at the fundus images, and you will see some contain rather severe damages to the retinal structure - these are signs of diabetic retinopathy (label "1").
You are welcome to use any and all resources at your disposal to try to train a model for this data - including pre-trained or not. 
For your first task, train 10 seeds of a model on this data. In your experiments, I would like to see train/valid split(s) of 0.8/0.2 - you can use these splits to do parameter optimization. You are free to use any and all augmentations during your training. 
Train your model in your environment of choice and submit plots that show the train and valid accuracy averaged across your 10 seeds!

Next, take a look at the images contained in 'retina1_test.zip'. As you will see from the filenames already, there seem to be different formats, indicating three different data sources.
Hence, before you blindly predict labels on these images, you will most likely want to make sure that:
- images are in the same "format" [same view of the retina]
- images have similar "color" format [to your training data]
Please try to modify the images before you predict their labels to the best of your ability. Then feed them to your model and predict the labels - your code needs to create a TEXT-file, which you will also need to include in your submission. 
The text file needs to be named [FIRST NAME]_[LAST NAME]_Test.txt
Its structure should be like this

image-name               [0,1] 

Each line is a single image file name, followed by a "TAB" and then the predicted label ("0", or "1"). Obtain this label as the majority vote across your 10 seeds!!!

BONUS: grad-cam some files and see what your models pay attention to ^^

Do all coding in a jupyter notebook called 'retina.ipynb' and submit the executed version with all plots and results and the *_Test.txt file as a zip-file to
